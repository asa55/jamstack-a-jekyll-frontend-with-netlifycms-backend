## Thanks for clicking this far into the site!

I know it looks a bit wacky at the moment, but the power of what I'm currently experimenting with is more backend-focused than frontend.

The frontend was built using a static site generator (Jekyll). Admittedly, writing this post in markdown and having it auto-generated as html is awesome and convenient.

What's more amazing to me is that I can integrate this SSG into a cloud-hosted content management system microservice (NetlifyCMS), with CI/CD provided by GitHub Actions!

The mock posts and authors can be added via the NetlifyCMS admin panel. (just append /admin/ to the root url of this site). I have it set up so that GitHub provides authentication and authorization services, and it's open to anyone with a GitHub account to post to. (Seriously, try it out if you'd like - it will trigger an automatic build and you'll see your post persist on this site).

Have fun! [Click here to go back to my home page](https://asa55.github.io)
